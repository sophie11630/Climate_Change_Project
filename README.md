# Impact of Climate Change on Solar Power

As our annual COâ‚‚ emissions increases exponentially, it is now a great threat to the living environment. To solve the problem, many countries shift towards low-carbon sources of energy, such as solar power. And this global movement brings enormous benefits for the solar industry around the world. 

#### <ins>Goal of this Project<ins/>
This project uses different models that could capture the nonlinear increasing trends of CO2 emission and solar energy generation and tests each performance on the validation set to find a best model using RMSE. We will also use the best forecast model to predict these variables in 2050 and provide insights on the climate.
